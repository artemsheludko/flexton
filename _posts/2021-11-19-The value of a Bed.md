It was _2014_ at Bangalore. I had only recently joined **Oracle** as a `Software Developer`.  
After a month of temporary accomodation, I had found a place to stay at a PG (_Paying Guest_). Although they call it a PG, its really like a hostel.  

I got a shared room. There were 3 other people in the room, and the rent was Rs. 5000, which is a decent amount considering they also provided food.  

Fortunately for me, I got pretty good room mates. We used to roam around the City, talk late into the night. It was all good.  

But, **I hated the room**.

It was a decently sized room.  
Attached bathroom.  
A window facing South.  
4 beds. One bed beside each wall.  

_Well, it was not what you would call a very comfortable room._

Enough ranting... Moving on to the story.

Everyday morning, I used to walk to the office.  
I had to cross a Graveyard, enter a small lane which had a temple followed by a mill from which the machine would make a rythmic sound. It was close to a kilometer to the office.  

One day, as usual I was going to office in the morning.  
As I was passing through the graveyard, I noticed something strange.  
There was a guy sleeping on the platform of the graveyard. This was an open platform for people to perform rituals before burying their near and dear.  
It was a cold day, and this person was not well covered. He was using his own clothing to cover him up.  
No, he didn't look like a random drunk guy sleeping.  
He looked as if he did not have any other place to sleep on.  

This shook me.  
I have been complaining to God about how small my room was.  
How uncomfortable my bed was.  

I never realized how much I had.  
I was focused on what I did not have.  
I was focused on the shortcomings of what I had.  

But, here is a guy sleeping on an open platform, with no blanket on, all alone.  

I took a moment. Thanked God for the bed that I had.  

We seldom take a moment to thank God for what we have. We keep complaining for what we don't have.  
If you have a shelter to sleep in, a bed to sleep on, you are a very fortunate person.

Take a moment. Thank God. For he has blessed you abondantly.
