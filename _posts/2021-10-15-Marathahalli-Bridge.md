This is a story that I wrote sitting on a but at a place called `Marathahalli` in `Bangalore`.  
The traffic was very bad, _as usual_.  
I was frustrated, late for office.
A private plane just flew by, and I felt jealous.  
And then it hit me. _A story_.  
I wrote this story sitting on the bus. And I completed it during the same journey.  

_Here it goes_

>The air traffic looks fine. The pilots are speaking on the radio with the airport authorities.  
The runway seems to be clear for landing.  
The private jet slows down, in preparation to land.  
The VIP slowly wakes up, comfortable on the leather cushioned seat.  
It was a comfortable ride.  
He gazes out, through the windows, on to Bangalore.  
He sees a long line.  
A long line of what!  
They are vehicles.  
Buy why are they not moving!  
Because they are on the MARATHAHALLI BRIDGE SIGNAL.  
In the long line, there is a 500 NA BMTC bus, on which sits **I**.  
I suddenly woke up from a long rough nap.  
I looked out of the window, to see the private jet subtly going out of sight to land at the airport.  
People are walking here and there. Everyone seem to be in a hurry.  
But why am I not moving!  
I gazed forward.  
We are in a traffic.  
Marathahalli bridge signal to be specific.  
Wait. WHAT!!!  
I suddenly looked at my watch.  
It says 11.  
REALLY!!  
The bus was on the other side of the bridge HALF AN HOUR ago.  
Now, half an hour later I have successfully moved around 300 metres.  
Thanks to some RIDICULOUS people, whom GOD KNOWS WHAT IS IN THEIR HEAD, thought it might be a good idea to keep a signal on a bridge, which seems to be a new idea on Earth.  
Yes.  
They have successfully screwed people's time and there by their life (_sort of_).  
So is mine.  
The END
